/*
 From SI read N strings not longer than 80 chars. At the beginning of the program read two integers:

N - number of strings you are going to read
X - shifting size.
Each of the read strings should be transformed in such a way that lowercase and uppercase letters (a-z, A-Z) are replaced with the same letter shifted X places afterwards in the alphabet (a-z). If you overflow the range of alphabet, continue cyclic from the beginning of the alphabet. Transformed string should be printed on SO.

Transformation of a string should be implemented in a separate recursive function.

Example:

Welcome -> transformed with shift 5 -> Bjqhtrj

 Input:
 16 10
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did.
All of five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all that she was
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything.
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...
I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head, I'm spinning, oh,
I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything...
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be... yeah...
